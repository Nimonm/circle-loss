# circle-loss
tf2.0 implementation of circle loss
see paper -> https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10857
* To do: currently the code has an issue with inf value caused by the exponential operation, will be fixed with crossentropy implementation by tensorflow (analogious to original implementation in https://github.com/TinyZeaMays/CircleLoss).
